# Cub3D

The goal of cub3d is to creat something using raycasting (like [this](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D))

## Run program
make sure you don't have a file named cub3d

```
git clone git@github.com:yumatsui00/Cub3D.git cub3d; cd cub3d; make; ./cub3D sample.cub
```
## USAGE
- w     -- move forward
- s     -- move backward
- a     -- turn left
- d     -- turn right
- space -- Dash
- tab   -- turn on/off the mouse to move your field of view
- m     -- show/hide minimap




### The code with a little bit of explanation about raycasting is [here](https://github.com/yumatsui00/Cub3D/tree/master/explain)
